Write a program that reads number of students and student scores. Find the best score from the given scores, and then assigns grades based on the following scheme:

* Grade is A if score is >= best - 10
* Grade is B if score is >= best - 20;
* Grade is C if score is >= best - 30;
* Grade is D if score is >= best - 40;
* Grade is F otherwise.
The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, then prompts the user to enter all of the scores, and concludes by displaying the grades.

code:
import java.util.Scanner;
/**
* 7.1 (Assign grades) Write a program that reads student scores, gets the best score,

* Grade is C if score is >= best - 30;
* Grade is D if score is >= best - 40;
* Grade is F otherwise.
